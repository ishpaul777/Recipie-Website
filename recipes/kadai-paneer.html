    <p>
        Kadai Paneer is a vibrant, tangy, deeply spiced paneer recipe that is perfect for enjoying all year round. Made with Indian pantry staples like onions, tomatoes, capsicum (green bell peppers) and Indian spices, this bright dish comes together in 30 minutes. I share two ways to make this curry – a semi dry restaurant style version and a spicy home style gravy.

    <em>That said, the freshly pounded kadai masala does lend a beautifully bold flavor to the recipe – if possible, I recommend you make it fresh.</em>

            Steps to Follow
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a spice-grinder, mixer-grinder or mortar-pestle, take 1.5 tablespoons coriander seeds and 5 to 6 Kashmiri red chilies. 
            </li>
            <em>TIP: Tear or break the dry chillies and remove the seeds before you make the kadai masala. Also ensure that your spices are fresh and without any molds or insects.</em>
            <li>
                Grind to a semi fine powder or a fine powder if you prefer. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a kadai, heat 3 tablespoons oil. Add ⅓ to ½ cup finely chopped onions.
            </li>
            <li> 
                Sauté onions on medium-low to medium heat until they soften and turn translucent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sauté for a few seconds till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now add 2.5 to 3 cups finely chopped tomatoes. The tomatoes have to be ripe, red and sweet. If tomatoes are not in season, I recommend using canned tomatoes that you pulse in a food processor or finely chopped cherry tomatoes
            </li>
            <li> 
                Then add the ground kadai masala to the tomatoes.Mix well. Sauté the tomatoes till the whole mixture turns into a paste and starts separating from the oil. (This method is called ‘bhunao’ in Hindi.) This tomato kadai masala paste will also begin to thicken and become glossy
            </li>
            <li>
                Now add ¾ to 1 cup capsicum julienne (thin slices).Sauté the capsicum for 3 to 4 minutes on medium-low to medium heat.
            </li>
            <em>
                NOTE: You can use red, orange, yellow or green colored capsicum, or a mix of various colored bell peppers can also be added.
            </em>
            <li>
                Add 1 to 2 green chilies or 1 small serrano pepper (slit) and about ½ cup water. Add less or more water as required.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix very well and sauté until the capsicum is al dente. If you prefer, you can cook the capsicum completely, but I prefer a bit of crunch to the dish
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the capsicum is cooked to your liking, add garam masala powder and salt as required. Mix these with the rest of the masala.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now add the paneer cubes (250 grams).Again, mix very well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lastly add 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), ginger julienne (from 1 inch ginger) and 2 tablespoons coriander leaves. Mix again and turn off the heat.
            </li>
            <em>
                NOTE: If you do not have kasuri methi, then simply omit them. Fresh ginger is a must, so do not skip; it imparts a great deal of fresh, zesty flavor to the dish.
            </em>
            <li>
                Serve Kadai Paneer hot from the pan with roti, naan, Paratha or pudina paratha.
            </li>
        </ol>
